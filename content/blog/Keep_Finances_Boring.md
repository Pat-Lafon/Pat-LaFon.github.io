# Keep Finances Boring

Occasionally I will talk with my friends about finances.

They are usually one of the following:

- The discussion is repetitive to others I have had.
- Sends me down a new rabbit hole which I either want to spread to others.
- I want to tell my friend about some new finance thing I learned/realized(lol nerd).

I think I am developing an overarching philosophy that you need to keep your
finances simple and boring else they will become your part-time job. The 80-20
rule is probably overused, but I think it applies here, you can do just 20% of
the work and get 80% of the benefit.

## Credit Cards

Off the bat, you should only have a credit card if you ALWAYS pay it off.

## Investments

There are probably a couple golden rules of investing, here are mine:

- Keep in mind how long you want to tie up this money for
- Keep in mind how quickly you want to be able to pull money out
- Keep in mind how much it costs relative to the amount of money you put in

I think this implies that one probably wants a couple tiers of investments

## Owning a Car

## Buying versus Renting

I don't think I'm at the stage in life where I can offer much advice here.
Generally they say that you need to plan to stay in a house for 7-ish years for
it to be worth buying. In some sense, I wonder if buying a house is more about
having financial and lifestyle stability.
