# About

<img src="../img/photo.jpeg" align="right" alt="drawing" width="50%"/>

I am a PhD student in CS at Purdue University, studying programming languages,
formal methods, automated reasoning, program synthesis, and refinement types
advised by Professor [Ben Delaware](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/).

I presented some upcoming work on synthesizing coverage-complete test input
generators at [MWPLS 2024](https://pl.cs.uchicago.edu/PLSummit/2024/). The
slides are available from
[Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRwFkr5lJ-eQdlhIbt5eFVJgRmeOvKtCs-v5-OFNea_SvWS-zoyHhkXllarlLqt-tZfcBrSuU5gWT2_/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
A preprint is available on Arxiv: [We've Got You Covered: Type-Guided
Repair of Incomplete Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06421).

In the summer of 2024 I interned at Amazon Web Services(AWS) as an Applied
Scientist. I combined my interests in Abstract
Interpretation, Refinement Types, and some classical ML(DBSCAN / K Nearest
Neighbors) to build a generalizable Anomaly Detection framework for AWS
services.

During my undergrad at Cornell University, I worked in the
[APL research group](https://github.com/apl-cornell) on bringing the
proposed [Gallifrey Programming Language](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/gallifrey/snapl.pdf) for distributed programming to life. I
finished as a member of the
[Capra research group](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/) where I worked on
designing a shallowly-embedded DSL for the CPU-GPU interface in Rust.

I have interned at IBM Research working on NLP models for corpus
conversion.

Occasionally I spend my free time(procrastinate) by adding features and tooling
to the
[Bril(Big Red Intermediate Language)](https://github.com/sampsyo/bril) compiler
IR. I help maintain a rust crate called
[LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) for parser generation. I
often like to contribute back to Rust crates that I use.

## Service

From 2022 to 2024 I co-lead the PurPL seminar.

I continue to hold the role of webmaster for the <a
href="https://purduepl.github.io/">PurPL</a> website.

I was a student volunteer at PLDI 2022 and PLDI 2023.

I have TA'd for the following courses

Purdue University:

- CS 456 (Undergraduate Programming Languages) - Fall 2022
- CS 38003 (Python Programming) - Spring 2023

Cornell University:
